# Pomodorro

[Test Out The App](https://project-pomodoro-timer-qualified-1-coral.vercel.app/)

## Context
A functioning Pomodoro timer.

## User
The user of this application would be a person who implements the Pomodoro productivity method in their work routine. 

## Uses
Set your "focus" and "break" durations, and then run the timer and work (or rest) accordingly.

## Features
* The ability to set the focus timer in 5 minute increments with a minimum of 5 minutes and a maximum of 60 minutes
* The break timer can similarly be set, except it has 1 minute increments with a minimum of 1 minutes and a maximum of 15 minutes
* Play, Pause, and Stop buttons. 
* A timer that will toggle by itself between "focus" and "break" durations
* A sound that plays whenever the timer hits 0 and is about to switch from "focus" to "break", or vise-versa.

## Technologies and Tools 
* React 
   *Components, props, useState, and hooks
* Bootstrap

## Discoveries
Working on this application got me well acquainted with global state. It also was my first experience using a custom hook. Learning how to actually make a countdown timer work was interesting as well.

## Future Goals 
It would be fun to work with different sounds to indicate that the timer is at 0, or even a possible "warning sound" that activates when there are 30 seconds left until the time is up.
